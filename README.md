# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION #

# BUSINESS PROBLEM #

Business problem is very simple, There is a Bank who wants to retain their existing customers who may churn, for that they have to know which existing customers has the highest probability of leaving the company and which customers have lowest probability of leaving the company.

Churning of customers is a big problem for banks, they want to maximise the retention of the customers so that they can plan their future projects.

Also if a Bank wants to get a funding from big investors, Rate of churning plays an important role.

So Bank wants to build a Machine Learning model which can predict whether a particular customer will churn or not.
